Personally, and I often hear this from various friends and colleagues too, as software developer I sometimes tend to over-engineer my approach to a new personal project. Instead of the language and tools that drive my day-to-day life at work, I could use a new language, a new framework or some other new thing I could try out. This often leads to the actual idea and project moving to the background, and trying to work with the new tools becomes the main thing. Sometimes this is fine, even needed, because that is how we broaden our horizons, but other times it might be useful to just take a step back and think about if simpler approaches or the tools we know might be the correct choice already.
